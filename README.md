This repository contains an implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch. The VAE is an unsupervised learning model that learns a probabilistic mapping from input data to a lower-dimensional latent space and reconstructs the input from this latent representation.
Features
Implements a standard VAE architecture using an encoder-decoder structure.
Uses PyTorch for model definition and training.
Supports training on MNIST and COCO datasets (configurable).
Includes image reconstruction and latent space visualization.
Supports customization for different datasets and architectures.
